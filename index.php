Life is meaningful with some words,
Time is important to motivate us all , 
Colours are important to colourful the world,
This colours are thinking us to which and what thing we may use,
We see rainbow to the sky, 
Which has 7colours like seven stars,
The colours of the rainbow,colourful the stars that may concern to work, 
create identity and make us colourful stars.
The colour is green,red and yellow we maintain the traffic jam, go to our destination in proper time.
The colours are red,blue, green and yellow to painting the nature in thousands time.
The nature, when white ,
White colour give us alive to give us green signal.
When black, 
Black colour give us attention far away 
From  red signal.
In the end we the people love our self 
Want to live and count the day time more and  more
Otherwise black colour make our life destroyed and give us lifeless alarm.
